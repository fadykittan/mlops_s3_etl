Resource APIs: Boto3 provides resource APIs that allow you to interact with AWS services using higher-level abstractions. These resource objects encapsulate the low-level service operations, making it more intuitive to work with AWS resources.\n","2. Session Management: Boto3 manages authentication and configuration settings through sessions. You can create a session by providing your AWS access key, secret key, and optional region and profile settings.\n","3. Automatic Retries: Boto3 has built-in support for automatic retries. It can handle common transient errors, such as throttling or service unavailability, by automatically retrying the failed requests with exponential backoff.\n","4. Pagination: Boto3 simplifies working with paginated results from AWS service APIs. It provides a paginator object that allows you to iterate over the results easily without having to handle pagination manually.\n","5. Waiters: Boto3 offers waiters that allow you to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with your code execution. For example, you can use a waiter to wait for an EC2 instance to reach a specific state before performing further actions.|"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c8b5c74d-b2f4-465b-af8b-65572812b08f","metadata":{"id":"c8b5c74d-b2f4-465b-af8b-65572812b08f"},"source":["To get started with Boto3, you need to install it using pip:\n","\n","`pip install boto3`\n","\n","Once installed, you can import the boto3 module in your Python code and start interacting with AWS services.
